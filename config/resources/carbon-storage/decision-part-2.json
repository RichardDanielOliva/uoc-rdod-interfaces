It comes at a cost and the question is: Is the cost incurred worth the gain for a specific project? In the case of CCS, information that would help determining with more certainty that a site is fit (or not) for injection would be the injectivity and pore space. Both quantities:<br>- have an impact on the main risk factors (Plume migration and Pressure build-up for injectivity and Land Area and plume migration for pore space). <br>- Are uncertain<br>- Can be measured through some additional test Drill stem Test (DST) for injectivity and Seismic acquisition for pore space<br>We establish how the results of these measurements (positively or negatively) impact the underlying risk factor and by connection, the goodness of the site.<br>We observe that while DST has a local effect, Seismic information informs on the Structure which affects both sites. We have the choice between a strong, local evidence and a weak, global one."
